# CMSC335Project3

# Overview
# In this project you will construct a Java Swing GUI that uses event handlers, listeners and incorporates
# Java’s concurrency functionality and the use of threads. 

# Assignment Details
# As a new engineer for a traffic congestion mitigation company, you have been tasked with developing a
# Java Swing GUI that displays time, traffic signals and other information for traffic analysts. The final GUI
# design is up to you but should include viewing ports/panels to display the following components of the
# simulation:
# 1. Current time stamps in 1 second intervals
# 2. Real-time Traffic light display for three major intersections
# 3. X, Y positions and speed of up to 3 cars as they traverse each of the 3 intersections
# Some of the details of the simulation are up to you but the following guidelines will set the guardrails:
# 1. The components listed above should run in separate threads.
# 2. Loop through the simulation with button(s) providing the ability to start, pause, stop and
# continue the simulation.
# 3. You will need to use basic distance formulas such as distance = Speed * time. Be sure to be
# consistent and define your units of measure (e.g. mile/hour, versus km/hour)
# 4. Assume a straight distance between each traffic light of 1000 meters.
# 5. Since you are traveling a straight line, you can assume Y = 0 for your X,Y positions.
# 6. Provide the ability to add more cars and intersections to the simulation through the GUI.
# 7. Don’t worry about physics. Assume cars will stop on a dime for red lights, and continue through
# yellow lights and green lights.
# 8. Document all assumptions and limitations of your simulation.
